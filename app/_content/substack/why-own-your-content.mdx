# Why You Should Own Your Content

After 3.5 months on Substack, I learned three hard truths:

## The Three Problems Every Substack Writer Faces

### 1. Google Can't Find You

Substack deliberately prevents new newsletters from being indexed on Google. They've removed sitemaps for smaller sites, which means it can take **many months** before Google's crawlers even discover your newsletter exists.

You can have the best SEO-optimized title in the world. Doesn't matter. The walled garden doesn't have a door for search engines to enter through.

**The result:** If you write something on Substack, Google doesn't index it. If Google doesn't index it, people searching for your topics won't discover you. Your audience growth from organic search? **Zero**.

### 2. Social Media Thinks Your Links Are Spam

Twitter/X actively censors Substack links—they don't show preview cards and they reduce visibility for posts containing Substack URLs.

This is petty platform warfare, and **writers are caught in the crossfire**.

Even on platforms that don't actively block Substack, the preview cards often fail to load properly or look unprofessional. When you share your work and the link appears as a bare URL with no context, people scroll past.

### 3. Platform Discovery Is Mostly Theoretical

Substack's discovery features—the "bestseller" and "rising" categories—only show paid newsletters. There's a **paradox** built into the platform: to reach broader audiences through Substack's discovery, you must paywall content from those audiences.

The organic growth from within Substack itself? Exceptionally slow.

## The Solution: Keep Substack, Add Your Own Site

You don't have to leave Substack. You don't have to migrate your email list. You don't have to lose your subscribers.

**Just make your articles visible on your own domain too.**

Here's what this gives you:

### For SEO

- Proper sitemaps that search engines can actually crawl
- Full control over meta tags and structured data
- Articles that appear in Google searches when people look for topics you write about
- The basic stuff that every website has had since 1995

### For Social Sharing

- Preview cards that work on every platform
- No censorship because Twitter can't block your domain without blocking the entire internet
- Professional presentation when links are shared

### For Growth

- Organic search traffic from Google
- Professional social sharing
- Full control over discovery
- Not dependent on a platform's dysfunctional discovery features

## How This Works

1. **Keep writing on Substack** - Your email list stays there, your subscribers stay there
2. **Export your articles** - Substack lets you download everything as HTML
3. **Display on your site** - Use this Next.js integration to show them beautifully
4. **Link to original** - Every article links back to the Substack version

Your readers can:
- Find you via Google search (new discovery)
- Share your articles on social media (working preview cards)
- Read on your site OR click through to Substack
- Subscribe to your newsletter from either place

## The Best of Both Worlds

You get:
- ✅ Substack's excellent email delivery
- ✅ Substack's payment processing
- ✅ Substack's comment system
- ✅ **PLUS** Google discoverability
- ✅ **PLUS** Working social previews
- ✅ **PLUS** Control over your content

## Your Content, Your Terms

The internet works best when creators own their platforms. This integration gives you that ownership **without** forcing you to abandon the tools that work.

Your content deserves to be discovered. Make it happen.
